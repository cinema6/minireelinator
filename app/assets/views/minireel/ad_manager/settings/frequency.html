two drop downs

here's an ng-ified dropdown from proshop
the options are bound
this example sets a default option but it's not necessary
I'll have a data model for the drop down options that connects readable values
like "Before 1st video is played" to the value we need to save ("0")
so if you want to hard code the options I can take the values form there

<select ng-model="data.org" name="org" ng-options="org.name for org in data.orgs | orderBy:'name'" required>
    <option value="">-- choose org --</option>
</select>
