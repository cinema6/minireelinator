<div>
two drop downs with titles above<br>
<br>
here's an ng-ified dropdown from proshop<br>
the options are bound<br>
this example sets a default option but it's not necessary<br>
I'll have a data model for the drop down options that connects readable values<br>
like "Before 1st video is played" to the value we need to save ("0")<br>
so if you want to hard code the options I can take the values form there
</div>

<select ng-model="data.org" name="org" ng-options="org.name for org in data.orgs | orderBy:'name'" required>
    <option value="">-- choose org --</option>
</select>
